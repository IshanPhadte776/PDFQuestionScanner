# PDFQuestionScanner
This Script can answer any question from a pdf file, even if the answer isn't explicit stated in the file. This Script will scan and embed the document, generate the list of key phrases which could be used to solve the query. Then use OpenAI as a language model for the response. Then a response will be generated.
